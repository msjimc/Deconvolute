# Deconvolute_Satggered

This fold contains the source code as well as two prebuilt programs one for Linux (Deconvolute_staggered.exe) and one for Windows (Deconvolute_staggered_windows.exe). The Linux version will probably need boost to be installed on the machine with zlib support in the iostreams libraries.
